## Who are we?
Genshin Wizard began as a fun side project in 2022, created to simplify the lives of Genshin Impact players by automating the wish pity count. What started as a small project quickly gained popularity, attracting hundreds of thousands of fellow travelers who found the bot incredibly useful. This overwhelming support inspired the development of Genshin Wizard into a comprehensive multi-utility Discord bot. Today, with thousands of daily users, Genshin Wizard is dedicated to enhancing your Genshin Impact experience.
